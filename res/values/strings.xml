    <string name="labelApplicationDescription1">This app vibrates the current time when the display
        is locked and the power button is pressed twice in a row with a delay between 500 and 1500
        milliseconds. It is started automatically after booting is finished.</string>
    <string name="labelApplicationDescription2">Basically there exist two different vibration
        pattern: A short vibration stands for the digit 1 and a long one for the digit 5. The 2
        is represented by two consecutive short vibrations, the 6 by a long and a short one and so
        on. The 0 constitutes an exception with two long vibrations.</string>
    <string name="labelApplicationDescription3">Examples:\n- 01:16 =   ..     s ... s .. l . s\n- 02:51 =   .. s . s ... l ..     s\n- 10:11 = s .. l . l ... s ..     s</string>
    <string name="labelApplicationDescription4">Explanation:\nThe time is processed digit by digit.
        s = short, l = long. A leading zero at the hour field is omitted. To simplify the
        recognition of the vibration pattern, there exist three kind of gabs with different
        durations, marked by the number of dots in the examples above. A single dot stands for the
        pause between two vibrations, two dots symbolize the separation of two digits within the
        hour and minute field and three dots split hours and minutes.</string>
